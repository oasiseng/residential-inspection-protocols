# Protocol: Visual Crack Classification (Drywall vs. Structural)

## Scope
Non-destructive visual classification of cracks in existing single-family homes to separate likely cosmetic movement from potential structural distress.

## Purpose
- Classify crack patterns as **Shrinkage/Thermal** or **Settlement/Lateral**.
- Identify escalation triggers for structural follow-up.
- Document conditions without opening finishes, coring, or destructive probing.

## Code Grounding (Performance Context)
- **IEBC Performance Compliance Methods (Chapter 14):** Evaluate whether existing conditions maintain acceptable safety/performance rather than forcing full prescriptive retrofit in every case.
- **IRC Existing Structures (R102.7):** Existing elements may remain when safe; field judgment must focus on performance and observed risk.

## Tools
- Flashlight
- 6 in. scale/ruler with 1/16 in. marks
- Crack gauge card (optional)
- Camera with date/time stamp
- Notepad/field form

## Safety + Non-Destructive Limits
- Do **not** remove finishes solely for initial classification.
- Do **not** chip plaster, core masonry, or excavate around foundations during this protocol.
- If immediate life-safety concerns are visible (active displacement, imminent collapse indicators), restrict access and escalate.

## Step 1: Establish Baseline Conditions
1. Record property address, area inspected, weather, and occupancy status.
2. Note building age (if known), recent renovations, and any reported movement history.
3. Photograph each crack with a scale in frame.

## Step 2: Classify the Crack Pattern

### A) Likely Shrinkage / Thermal (Typically Cosmetic)
Common indicators:
- Hairline width (generally ≤ 1/16 in.).
- Vertical or gently diagonal cracks at drywall joints.
- Localized cracking near door/window corners without offset.
- Corner bead cracking with no frame distortion.

Interpretation:
- Often related to material shrinkage, temperature cycling, or minor seasonal movement.
- Usually monitor/repair category unless progression is documented.

### B) Possible Settlement / Lateral Movement (Potential Structural)
Common indicators:
- Width > 1/8 in. (especially if widening trend is reported or observed).
- Step-cracking in masonry/block patterns.
- Horizontal foundation wall cracks.
- Crack with measurable displacement/offset across the plane.
- Repeating cracks aligned through multiple finishes/levels.

Interpretation:
- May indicate differential settlement, lateral soil pressure, or load-path distress.
- Requires escalation for structural evaluation.

## Step 3: Cross-Check with Context (Non-Destructive)
- Check for companion indicators: sloped floors, sticking doors, out-of-square frames, separated trim, or new water intrusion.
- Compare interior and exterior locations for pattern continuity.
- Distinguish isolated finish defects from system-level movement.

## Step 4: Decision Framework
- **Monitor:** Hairline, non-progressive, no displacement, no corroborating distress.
- **Repair + Monitor:** Minor finish cracking with localized serviceability issues.
- **Escalate:** > 1/8 in., horizontal/step pattern, displacement, recurring pattern across structural lines, or rapid change.

## What AI Gets Wrong
- **False alarm bias:** LLMs often label cosmetic corner bead or drywall tape cracks as “foundation failure.”
- **Pattern blindness:** AI may ignore orientation/width/displacement and overfit to dramatic internet examples.
- **Prescriptive overreach:** AI may recommend immediate destructive testing before completing visual performance-based triage.

## Documentation Minimum
- Crack location map (room/elevation).
- Measured width and orientation.
- Displacement present/absent.
- Photo set with scale.
- Final classification and escalation recommendation.
