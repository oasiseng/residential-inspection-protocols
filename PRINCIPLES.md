# Principles for Residential Field Verification

## 1) Safety Before Certainty
If a test increases risk to occupants, installed equipment, or the structure, stop and choose a less invasive method.

## 2) Non-Invasive by Default
Treat destructive testing as a last resort. Document why non-destructive alternatives are insufficient before opening finishes or disconnecting major systems.

## 3) Field Reality Over Theoretical Purity
Residential systems in service contain mixed loads, undocumented modifications, and partial compliance. Protocols must be practical under those real-world constraints.

## 4) Explicit Scope and Limits
Every protocol must state:

- What it validates.
- What it does not validate.
- Preconditions required for safe execution.

## 5) Chain of Responsibility
Engineering judgment remains with the licensed professional. AI tools, templates, and checklists are advisory and cannot replace field observation or code-aware interpretation.

## 6) Traceable Documentation
Record the date, location, observed conditions, instrument used, and decision made for each critical step.

## 7) Escalation Triggers
If observed conditions exceed the protocol’s scope (active arcing, structural movement, severe moisture intrusion, hidden energized conductors), stop and escalate immediately.
