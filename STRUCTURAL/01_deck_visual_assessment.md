# Protocol: Residential Deck Visual Assessment (Non-Invasive)

## Scope
Visual-only assessment of residential deck framing and connections where finishes remain in place.

## Objectives

- Identify obvious safety defects.
- Document conditions requiring immediate restriction or further investigation.

## Procedure

1. **Global observation**
   - Note deck geometry, apparent slope, and signs of differential movement.
2. **Connection review**
   - Check ledger attachment indicators, post-to-beam connectors, and visible hardware corrosion.
3. **Member condition review**
   - Look for splitting, decay, crushing, and moisture damage on joists/posts/beams.
4. **Support and bearing review**
   - Observe post alignment, base condition, and signs of settlement.
5. **Surface behavior**
   - Walk deck surface carefully for unusual deflection, bounce, or vibration.

## Immediate Escalation Criteria

- Visible ledger separation risk.
- Advanced decay at primary load path elements.
- Severe connector corrosion or missing critical connectors.
- Sudden movement, audible cracking, or unstable bearing.
