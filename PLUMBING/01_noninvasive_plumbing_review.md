# Protocol: Non-Invasive Plumbing Review (Residential)

## Scope
Visual and operational checks for residential plumbing systems without destructive opening of walls, slabs, or ceilings.

## Objectives

- Identify active leaks or moisture indicators.
- Confirm fixture operation and drainage behavior.
- Flag escalation conditions for invasive follow-up.

## Procedure

1. **Document baseline conditions**
   - Note occupancy status, recent usage, and water service state.
2. **Visual scan**
   - Inspect supply connections, traps, valves, and visible drain lines.
   - Look for corrosion, staining, mineral deposits, and prior patching.
3. **Functional fixture checks**
   - Run fixtures sequentially; observe pressure stability and flow.
   - Check drain-down time and trap retention.
4. **Targeted moisture checks**
   - Use a moisture meter at high-risk transitions (cabinet bases, tub surrounds, water heater area).
5. **Record findings**
   - Mark each area as Pass / Monitor / Escalate.

## Stop/Escalate Conditions

- Active leak at pressurized fitting.
- Sewer gas odor with no obvious trap failure.
- Recurring moisture signatures in concealed-area boundaries.
- Evidence of structural impact from chronic leakage.
