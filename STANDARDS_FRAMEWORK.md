# Standards & Code Framework (Residential Existing Homes)

## Why this framework exists
This handbook is intended for **field triage in existing single-family homes**, not lab testing or full design packages. The goal is to ground procedures in credible references while keeping methods non-destructive and practical.

## Governing hierarchy for this repo
1. **Life Safety + AHJ Requirements (highest priority)**
2. **Adopted code for existing conditions** (IEBC/IRC/IBC as applicable)
3. **Recognized standards** (ASTM/ISO/ASHRAE/industry guidance)
4. **Engineering judgment from field observations**

## Core code basis (performance-first for existing homes)
- **IEBC** (International Existing Building Code): Primary framework for evaluating existing-building performance and risk without defaulting to full prescriptive replacement.
- **IRC** (International Residential Code): Residential baseline for one- and two-family dwellings; use to contextualize whether observed conditions are unsafe or noncompliant.
- **IBC** (International Building Code): Useful when evaluating mixed-use edge cases, structural concepts, or jurisdictional overlays that reference IBC provisions.

## Recommended standards map by function

### A) Field inspection process quality
- **ASTM E2018** (Property Condition Assessments): Good structure for scope, walk-through logic, and report discipline.
- **ISO/IEC 17020** (inspection body competence): Helpful governance model for independence, consistency, and traceability.
- **ISO/IEC 17025** (testing/calibration competence): Use conceptually for instrument-control rigor (calibration status, traceability).

### B) Structural / envelope triage
- **ASTM C1193** (joint sealants guide): Useful for evaluating sealant-related crack/interface observations.
- **ASTM E2128** (water leakage investigation): Useful methodology reference when crack/moisture symptoms overlap envelope leakage.
- **ASTM D5434** (field visual assessment of wood): Practical visual language for decay/distress screening.

### C) Plumbing performance triage
- Use **IEBC/IRC performance intent** as primary basis for serviceability checks in occupied homes.
- Where advanced diagnostics are required, standards should be invoked by licensed specialists with methods matched to system age/material risk.

### D) HVAC performance triage
- **ASHRAE 55** (thermal environmental conditions): Occupant comfort context.
- **ASHRAE 62.2** (residential ventilation): Ventilation adequacy context.
- Treat invasive refrigerant diagnostics as second-line work after non-invasive Delta-T/airflow checks.

## Rules for citing standards in this repository
- Every protocol should distinguish:
  - **Required basis:** adopted code or life-safety requirement.
  - **Guidance basis:** standard used to structure method or interpretation.
- If a standard is cited, include:
  - Why it is relevant to **existing residential** conditions.
  - Whether the protocol uses it directly or only as contextual guidance.
- Never use a standard citation to justify destructive testing in occupied homes unless explicitly required and risk-managed.

## Anti-hallucination controls for standards
- Do not cite a standard unless the exact designation is verified.
- Do not imply ASTM/ISO/ASHRAE standards are legally adopted unless confirmed by jurisdiction.
- Prefer “performance intent” language when code-path is uncertain in existing homes.
